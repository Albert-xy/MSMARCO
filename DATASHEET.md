# Datasheet for MSMARCO
## Motivation for Dataset Creation
### Why was the dataset created? (e.g., was there a specific task in mind? was there a specific gap that neededto be filled?)

### What (other) tasks could the dataset be used for?

### Has the dataset been used for any tasks already? If so, where are the results so others can compare (e.g.,links to published papers)?

### Who funded the creation of the dataset?

### Any other comments?

## Dataset Composition
### What are the instances?(that is, examples; e.g., documents, images, people, countries) Are there multiple types of instances? (e.g., movies, users, ratings; people, interactions between them; nodes, edges)

### Are relationships between instances made explicit in the data(e.g., social network links, user/movie ratings, etc.)?

### How many instances are there?(of each type, if ap-propriate)?

### What data does each instance consist of? “Raw” data  (e.g.,  unprocessed  text  or  images)?   Features/attributes?  Is there a label/target associated with instances? If the instances related to people, are subpopulations identified (e.g., by age, gender, etc.) and what is their distribution?

### Is everything included or does the data rely on external resources? (e.g., websites, tweets, datasets) If external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) is there an official archival version; c) are there access restrictions or fees?

### Are there recommended data splits and evaluation measures? (e.g., training, development, testing; accuracy or AUC)

### What experiments were initially run on this dataset?

### Any other comments?

## Data Collection Process
### How was the data collected?

### Who was involved in the data collection process? (e.g., students, crowdworkers) and how were they compensated (e.g., how much were crowdworkers paid)?

### Over what time-frame was the data collected?

### Does the collection time-frame match the creation timeframe of the instances?

### How was the data associated with each instance acquired?

### Was the data directly observable (e.g., raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (e.g., surveyresponses), or indirectly inferred/derived from otherdata (e.g., part of speech tags; model-based guesses for age or language)? If the latter two, were they validated/verified and if so how?

### Does the dataset contain all possible instances? Or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the population? What was the sampling strategy (e.g., deterministic, probabilistic with specific sampling probabilities)? Is the sample representative of the larger set (e.g., geographic coverage)? If not, why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range of instances)? How does this affect possible uses?

### Is there information missing from the dataset and why? (this does not include intentionally dropped instances; it might include, e.g., redacted text, withheld documents) Is this data missing because it was unavailable?

### Any other comments?

##Data Preprocessing
### What preprocessing/cleaning was done? (e.g., discretization or bucketing, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, SIFT feature extraction, removal of instances)Was the “raw” data saved in addition to the preprocessed/cleaned data? (e.g., to support unanticipated future uses) 

### Is the preprocessing software available?

### Does this dataset collection/processing procedure achieve the motivation for creating the dataset stated in the first section of this datasheet? If not, what are the limitations?

### Any other comments?

## Dataset Distribution

### How will the dataset be distributed? (e.g., tarball on website, API, GitHub; does the data have a DOI and is it archived redundantly?)

### When will the dataset be released/first distributed?

### What license (if any) is it distributed under?

### Are there any copyrights on the data?

### Are there any fees or access/export restrictions?

### Any other comments?

## Dataset Maintenance
### Who is supporting/hosting/maintaining the dataset?

### Will the dataset be updated?

### If so, how often and by whom?

### How will updates be communicated?(e.g., mailinglist, GitHub)

### Is there an erratum?

### If the dataset becomes obsolete how will this be com-municated?

### Is there a repository to link to any/all papers/systems that use this dataset?

### If others want to extend/augment/build on this dataset, is there a mechanism for them to do so. If so, is there a process for tracking/assessing the quality of those contributions. What is the process for communicating/distributing these contributions to users?

### Any other comments?

## Legal & Ethical Considerations
### If the dataset relates to people (e.g., their attributes) or was generated by people, were they informed about the data collection? (e.g., datasets that collect writting, photos, interactions, transactions, etc.)

###If it relates to people, were they told what the dataset would be used for and did they consent? If so, how? Were they provided with any mechanism to revoke their consent in the future or for certain uses?

### If it relates to people, could this dataset expose people to harm or legal action? (e.g., financial social or otherwise) What was done to mitigate or reduce the potential for harm?

### If it relates to people, does it unfairly advantage or disadvantage a particular social group? In what ways? How was this mitigated?

### If it relates to people, were they provided with privacy guarantees? If so, what guarantees and how are these ensured?

### Does the dataset comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)?

### Does it comply with any other standards, such as the US Equal Employment Opportunity Act?

### Does the dataset contain information that might be considered sensitive or confidential? (e.g., personally identifying information)

### Does the dataset contain information that might be considered inappropriate or offensive?

### Any other comments?
